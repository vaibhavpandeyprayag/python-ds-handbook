# Python Data Science Handbook
## Author: Jake VanderPlas

### Repository Introduction
The book mentioned above was read to understand the fundamentals of Python tools and libraries necessary for learning Data Science. While reading the book, some of its code samples were executed for practising. These codes have been uploaded to this repo. 

### Files
Every Jupyter notebook file in this repo corresponds to a chapter in the book, though chapter 1 was omitted.

### Environment Setup
A conda envirnonment named "py39" was created. This env contained Python 3.9.25 and other needed tools and libraries such as jupyter, ipykernel, numpy, pandas, etc. \
For coding purpose, Visual Studio Code was used by installing following extensions:\
1. Jupyter Extension Pack
2. Python
3. Pylance
4. Python Debugger

### Note
conda could not install jupyter and ipykernel. Therefore pip was used instead.
